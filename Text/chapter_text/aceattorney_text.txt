overexert yourself.[A][N]
You wouldn't want to be[N]
getting sick, would you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, yeah[Beat][A][N]
I'm fine, really![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, if you say so.[A][N]
Have you gone over the case?[A]

accused of[Beat] [ToggleRed]murder[ToggleRed].[A][N]
But I just know he's innocent![A][N]
There's no way he did it.[N]
Not him![.....] No way![A]

Good morning, Tobin![A]

Oh hey Alm, how are you?[A][N]

put on trial for murder" thing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Uh, are you sure you're[N]
okay with[Beat] me?[A][N]
I mean, I've never stood[N]

more with this than you.[A]

The prosecution is[N]
ready, Your Honor.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadAlm][ToggleMouthMove]
(Who is that?[N]

Just, a lot less angry...)[A]

The prosecution's opening statement,[N]
if you would be so kind.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBerkut]
The crime took place[N]
here, in Ram Village.[A][N]
The defendant, Mr. Tobin,[N]
took a knife[Beat][A][N]
and stabbed the victim[N]
straight through the heart![A][N]
The defendant was on[N]
guard duty, it seems.[A][N]
This is the weapon that[N]
took the victim's life.[A][N]
[ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadNomah]
The court accepts[N]
this as evidence.[A]
#here it gets added to the court record (alm's inventory)
[X]

## AAScene2Talk2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNomah]
So, the victim was a[N]
resident of Ram Village?[A][N]
[ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBerkut]
Yes, your honor.[A][N]
One [ToggleRed]Gray[ToggleRed].[A]
[ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadNomah]
Such a good lad[Beat][A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBerkut]
The prosecution would like[N]
to call their first witness.[A][N]
Detective, please take the stand.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[LoadOverworldFaces] #load forsyth and move him to the stand
[OpenRight][LoadForsyth]
[.......][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBerkut]
Detective, please testify as to[N]
what evidence you've uncovered.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadForsyth]
Of course![N]
Leave it to me![A][X]

## AATestimony1
[OpenLeft][LoadForsyth]
The victim was killed[N]
with this knife.[A][N]
The blood on the knife[N]
belongs to the victim.[A][N]
The defendant's fingerprints[N]
were found on the handle.[A][N]
We think he was killed[N]
near the village gates.[A]
[X]

## AAScene3Talk1

## AAScene3Talk2
[OpenLeft][LoadNomah]
The defense may now[N]
cross-examine the witness.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadAlm][OpenFarRight][LoadCelica]
Alm, this is your 
first time in court.[A][N]
Let me explain how[N]
to [ToggleRed]cross-examine[ToggleRed].[A]
#Here we go into the setup for cross-examining
[X]


## AACrossExaminationTutorial1
[OpenMidRight][LoadCelica]
Each unit in the middle of the[N]
floor represents a [ToggleRed]statement[ToggleRed].[A]
[CloseSpeechSlow][LoadOverworldFaces] #do cursor flash on each statement
Move just below statement, and[N]
you can interact with it.[A][N]
If you [ToggleRed]Hear[ToggleRed] the statement,[N]
you can listen to that statement again.[A][N]
If you [ToggleRed]Press[ToggleRed] the statement,[N]
you can get more information.[A][N]
If you think you've spotted a contradiction,[A][N] [ToggleRed]Present[ToggleRed] evidence that[N]
conflicts with the statement.[A][N]
If you're stumped, feel free[N]
to [ToggleRed]Consult[ToggleRed] with me.[A][N]
I'll help you think things through.[A]
[CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace][LoadAlm][ToggleMouthMove]
(So basically, I [ToggleRed]Present[ToggleRed] evidence if[N]
I spot a contradiction,[A][N]
and [ToggleRed]Press[ToggleRed] if I don't...)[A][N]
(Makes sense to me. Let's go!)[A][X]




## AATestimony1Statement1
[OpenLeft][LoadForsyth]
The victim was killed[N]
with this knife.[A][X]

## AATestimony1Press1
[OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
By "this knife", you mean[N]
the Murder Knife, correct?[A]
[ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadForsyth]
Yep! That's the one![A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
Well, how do you know that this[N]
knife is the murder weapon?[A]
[ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadForsyth]
I'm glad you asked! You see[Beat][A][X]

## AATestimony1Statement2
[OpenLeft][LoadForsyth]
The blood on the knife[N]
belongs to the victim.[A][X]

## AATestimony1Press2
[OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
[Beat]Okay, but that doesn't prove[N]
it was my client who used the knife![A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBerkut]
[Beat][A][N]
Do you ever think[N]
before you leap?[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
[Beat]I'm sorry?[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBerkut]
Witness, tell us how we know[N]
the defendant is the murderer.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadForsyth]
Certainly! You see,[Beat][A][X]

## AATestimony1Statement3
[OpenLeft][LoadForsyth]
The defendant's fingerprints[N]
were found on the handle.[A][X]

## AATestimony1Press3
[OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
W-well, how do you know[N]
they're his fingerprints?[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBerkut]
I know this is your[N]
first day in court,[A][N]
but you could at least act[N]
like you know what you're doing.[A][N]
Asking dumb questions gets you nowhere.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadNomah]
The defense will refrain from[N]
asking further dumb questions.[A][X]

## AATestimony1Statement4
[OpenLeft][LoadForsyth]
We think he was killed[N]
near the village gates.[A][X]

## AATestimony1Press4
[OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
How did you come to[N]
that conclusion?[A]
[ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadForsyth]
Well, the body was found in some[N]
bushes just next to the gates.[A][N]
There wasn't a trail of blood,[A][N]
and there was blood all[N]
over the bushes.[A][N]
If the body had been moved,[N]
it would have left more bloodstains.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
I[Beat] see[Beat][A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]
(This is looking worse[N]
and worse by the second...)[A][ToggleMouthMove][X]

## AAIncorrectPresent
[OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
There's a contradiction in[N]
your last statement![A]
[ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadNomah]
There is? Where?[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
Oh, uhh[Beat][A]
[ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadNomah]
Mr. Rudolf, please do not[N]
waste this court's time.[A][X]

## AATestimony1Consult
[OpenMidRight][LoadCelica]
Alm, I don't think you'll find[N]
a contradiction in this testimony.[A][N]
Press him for more information,[N]
and see where that gets us.[A][X]
