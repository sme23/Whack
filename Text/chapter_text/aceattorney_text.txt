The prosecution's opening statement,[N]
if you would be so kind.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBerkut]
The crime took place[N]
here, in Ram Village.[A][N]
The defendant, Mr. Tobin,[N]
took a knife[Beat][A][N]

straight through the heart![A][N]
The defendant was on[N]

## AATestimony1Statement1
[OpenLeft][LoadForsyth]
The victim was killed[N]
with this knife.[A][X]

## AATestimony1Press1
[OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
By "this knife", you mean[N]
the Murder Knife, correct?[A]
[ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadForsyth]
Yep! That's the one![A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
Well, how do you know that this[N]
knife is the murder weapon?[A]
[ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadForsyth]
I'm glad you asked! You see[Beat][A][X]

## AATestimony1Statement2
[OpenLeft][LoadForsyth]
The blood on the knife[N]
belongs to the victim.[A][X]

## AATestimony1Press2
[OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
[Beat]Okay, but that doesn't prove[N]
it was my client who used the knife![A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBerkut]
[Beat][A][N]
Do you ever think[N]
before you leap?[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
[Beat]I'm sorry?[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBerkut]
Witness, tell us how we know[N]
the defendant is the murderer.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadForsyth]
Certainly! You see,[Beat][A][X]

## AATestimony1Statement3
[OpenLeft][LoadForsyth]
The defendant's fingerprints[N]
were found on the handle.[A][X]

## AATestimony1Press3
[OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
W-well, how do you know[N]
they're his fingerprints?[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBerkut]
I know this is your[N]
first day in court,[A][N]
but you could at least act[N]
like you know what you're doing.[A][N]
Asking dumb questions gets you nowhere.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadNomah]
The defense will refrain from[N]
asking further dumb questions.[A][X]

## AATestimony1Statement4
[OpenLeft][LoadForsyth]
We think he was killed[N]
near the village gates.[A][X]

## AATestimony1Press4
[OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
How did you come to[N]
that conclusion?[A]
[ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadForsyth]
Well, the body was found in some[N]
bushes just next to the gates.[A][N]
There wasn't a trail of blood,[A][N]
and there was blood all[N]
over the bushes.[A][N]
If the body had been moved,[N]
it would have left more bloodstains.[A]

There are [ToggleRed]two guard towers[ToggleRed].[A][N]
I was in the rightmost one.[A][X]

## AATestimony2Statement2

Then, I heard a scream![A][X]

## AATestimony2Press2
[OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
A scream?[A][N]
Do you have an idea[N]
of what time it was?[A]
[ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadKliff]
Yeah, it was right[N]
around 1:00 AM.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadAlm][ToggleMouthMove]

## AATestimony2Press3
[OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
Y-you did[Beat]?[A]
[ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadKliff]
That's right.[A][N]
It was definitely[N]
Tobin's voice.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
Well, what did he say?[A]
[ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadKliff]
Yeah, about that[Beat][A][X]


## AATestimony2Statement4

But I couldn't make[N]
out what he said.[A][X]

## AATestimony2Press4

Oh[Beat][N]
Then, that doesn't implicate[N]
him in the crime![A]
[LoadOverworldFaces] #Objection!
[ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBerkut]
It still places him[N]

## AATestimony2Statement5
[OpenRight][LoadKliff]
I heard the scream at[Beat][N]
It was around 1:00 AM.[A][X]

## AATestimony2Press5
[OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
You're absolutely[N]

[ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadKliff]
Absolutely.[A][N]
Every night at exactly 1:00,[N]
the nearby bandits have[N]
a very loud celebration.[A][N]
There's only so many times[N]
they can scare you silly,[A][N]
before you start knowing[N]
when to prepare for the noise[Beat][A][X]

## AATestimony2Consult1
[OpenFarRight][LoadCelica]
I don't see anything inconsistent[N]

Try pressing for more information.[N]
You may uncover a contradiction.[A][X]

## AATestimony2Consult2

you heard the scream at 1:00 AM?[A]
[ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadKliff]

Well, I'm afraid[N]

It was around 2:00 AM, and I[N]

Tobin was supposed to be[N]

There's on thing that's[N]

You were at the[N]

Do you have an alibi for this?[A]
[ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadKliff]
Of course![A][X]

He never came back, so I was[N]

[OpenMidRight][LoadAlm]
So you never left[N]
