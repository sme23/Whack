exclamation graphic at 9add4c

might be better to not do that though

draw it like a hp bar?

203a21b changes to 01 when unit selected

When a unit is selected
  AND the current unit is an enemy
  AND the current unit's equipped weapon is effective vs the active unit
  then display a ! sign over their head

Sound good?
Let's do this

so adding to the end of the HP bars routine:

(current unit in r4)
if 203a21b = 1
  if [r4,0xb] AND 0x80 <> 0
    Loop through items (0x1e, 5 halfwords)
      if 0, end loop
      else
      0x16BEC - 0x16C86: Given item and pointer to defender, return 0 if not effective and 1 if effective.
      if 1, draw exclamation mark and end loop
      if 5 items checked, end loop
