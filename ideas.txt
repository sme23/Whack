we're gonna do some dumb shit ok
anthology hack that contains ~30 chapters of largely independent gameplay
includes remakes of previous 1-chapter hacks (?)
perhaps can use this as an opportunity to properly create some chapters taking advantage of the various mechanical asm things i've done
so we get like

the 4 things on the stat screen should be in every map
fatigue disabled via chapter ID to start using fatigue when it's not being used for a given chapter

Laguz used as laguz for a map

	- Skirmish in Gallia
	- you control various gallians and fight against daein accompanied by some raven laguz
